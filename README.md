This program is merely a faster way to use a Notepad file on a shared drive to store and share quick links, code snippets, etc. between machines.

When you launch the .exe, you'll be prompted for a source file.  Choose a .txt file on any shared drive or folder.

The program auto-saves whatever is pasted or typed to the text file.  When switching to another machine, right-click to refresh the text.

It auto-loads the same file every time unless you change it.  Choose Light or Dark Mode.
